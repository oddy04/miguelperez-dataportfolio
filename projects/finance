# 💰 Credit Risk & Personal Loan Acceptance Analysis

### 🧩 Project Overview
This project explores the factors influencing **personal loan acceptance** using real-world bank data.  
The goal was to help financial institutions identify the most promising clients and reduce marketing costs.

---

### 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Cleaned and processed missing data.
- Performed **One-Hot Encoding** for categorical variables such as *Family* and *Education*.
- Found that **Income** and **CD Account ownership** are the strongest predictors of loan acceptance.
- Visualized income distribution and acceptance patterns using Python (Matplotlib & Seaborn).

---

### 🧠 Model Development
Built a **Logistic Regression** model with:
- `scikit-learn` for model training and evaluation  
- `train_test_split` for data partition  
- Metrics: **Precision**, **Recall**, and **Confusion Matrix**

**Performance:**
- Precision: 91%  
- Recall: 89%  
*(adjust these with your real values once you finalize your model)*

---

### 🚀 Key Insights
- Clients with higher income (>100K) have significantly higher acceptance rates.  
- Having a **CD Account** increases the likelihood of accepting a personal loan.  
- Targeting these segments can reduce acquisition costs by up to **(100 - Precision)%**.
