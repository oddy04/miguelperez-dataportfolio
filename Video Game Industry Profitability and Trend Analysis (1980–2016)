# 🎮 Global Video Game Industry Performance Analysis (1980–2016)

## 📘 Overview
This project analyzes global video game sales from 1980 to 2016 using **Python (Pandas)** for data cleaning and **SQL (BigQuery)** for business insights.  
It demonstrates the complete data analytics workflow — from cleaning and data modeling (star schema) to profitability and trend analysis.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Design a **star schema** data model (fact and dimension tables).  
- Clean and normalize data using **Python (Pandas)**.  
- Load data into **BigQuery** and run SQL-based analysis.  
- Identify patterns of **editorial profitability** and **genre trends** over time.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python (Pandas, Colab / Jupyter)**  
- **SQL (Google BigQuery)**  
- **Data Modeling (Star Schema)**  
- **CSV** for integration between Python and BigQuery

## 💡 Key Insights

### 🏆 Profitability (CTE)
- **Nintendo** achieved the highest average sales per title, reflecting strong IP management and brand dominance.  

### 📈 Temporal Trends
- In the last decade of the dataset, **Action** and **Shooter** genres led global sales.  
- A steady decline was observed in classic genres such as **Sports** and **Platform** after 2010.

## 🧮 SQL Analysis
The file [`game_sales_analysis.sql`](sql/game_sales_analysis.sql) contains three main sections:

1. **Star Schema Validation**  
   Joins between fact and dimension tables to ensure referential integrity.  

2. **Profitability Analysis (CTEs)**  
   Top 10 publishers ranked by average sales per title.  

3. **Temporal Trends Analysis**  
   Yearly and genre-based global sales trends.

## ⚙️ How to Reproduce the Project
1. Run the notebook [`cleaning.ipynb`](notebooks/cleaning.ipynb) to clean and export CSVs.  
2. Create a dataset in BigQuery: `vgsales_analisis_sql`.  
3. Upload the CSVs (`fact_ventas_juegos`, `dim_editoriales`, `dim_generos`).  
4. Execute the SQL queries from `game_sales_analysis.sql`.
